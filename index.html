                        Bob saved my life, simply put.  About a year ago I went to his acupuncture and wellness clinic in very poor health. I was so Ill I was actually in the process of having my will made out. Since my first visit I have lost over 70 lbs, my heart murmur is gone and the diagnosis of congestive heart failure is no longer on my records. Needless to say this is  “The Best Care Ever Received” anywhere in my long life.

                        <p>
                            Acupuncture is an ancient form of medicine that is gaining popularity in the U.S. During treatment, very thin, solid, hair-like needles are inserted at specific points on the body. The stimulation of these acupuncture points affect the central and peripheral nervous systems. It triggers the release of the body’s internal chemicals, such as endorphins and enkephalins, which have pain-relieving properties.

                        <p>
                            The Acupuncture and Wellness Center, P.S. and its founder Bob Doane, are known world-wide as experts in the art of Chinese Pulse diagnosis. At the first visit to the clinic our practitioners will examine your pulse thoroughly and provide a complete analysis of your overall health condition as revealed in your pulse.

                        <p>
                            The number of treatments depends on the duration, severity, and nature of the complaint. Generally, 10 to 20 treatments are adequate for the majority of chronic (long-lasting) disorders. Some acute (short-term) conditions may require only one treatment. Some degenerative conditions may require more. The patient has the right to expect their major complaint will be addressed and treated in a direct and timely manner.
